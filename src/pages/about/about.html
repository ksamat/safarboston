    Safar Boston was founded over 40 years ago by brothers Jean-Pierre, Gaston and Serge, after moving to Boston from the South of France. Their passion and creative drive have made them successful and well-known personalities in the beauty industry. Nowadays you can still find Serge and Gaston working at their salons in Boston and Miami, together with other generations of the Safar family. Much has changed since the 1970’s, but their constant drive to redefine the avant garde of styling – while providing high-quality service – remains the same.

    Safar has consequently become one of the preeminent names in styling. Serge, and many on the Safar team, consistently style fashion week shows across the globe, including Zac Posen, Prada, Rad Hourani, Isa Arfen, Milly, Cynthia Rowley and Matthew Ames, to name a few. They have collaborated with some of the biggest names in hair, such as Wella, Goldwell, and Oribe. And locally, Safar has become a staple of Boston Fashion Week and Fashion’s Night Out.
